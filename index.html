      <p><strong>🔧 Attribution Statement for SimplePlumbingRepairs</strong><br><br>
        This website was created as part of a classroom project to demonstrate the structure and conceptual potential of a commercial plumbing repair site. It is designed solely for academic evaluation and remains private, accessible only to the course instructor and a peer reviewer.<br><br>
        Very limited content has been referenced from <em>Plumbing: A Homeowner’s Guide</em> by Steve Cory, published by Taunton Press (USA, 2016, ISBN: 10987654321). A total of four pages from the 214-page book were used as sources, focusing on essential repair and installation methods. All referenced material has been rephrased and adapted for educational purposes and incorporated in a transformative manner.<br><br>
        Specific references include:<br>
        • Kitchen Repairs: Page 157 — rephrased instructions for installing an under-the-sink water filter, with one image from the book used for illustration.<br>
        • Bathroom Toilet Repairs:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;o Diagnosing and replacing a faulty flapper in a leaking toilet bowl.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;o Identifying and correcting a continuous water flow issue by replacing the water control mechanism.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;o Two images from the book were used to support these explanations.<br><br>
        All additional photographs throughout the website are original and owned by the creator. The use of content from the referenced book falls under fair use, as it serves a non-commercial, educational purpose, includes minimal material relative to the original work, and does not substitute or compete with the original publication.
