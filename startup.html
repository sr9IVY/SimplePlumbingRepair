	    <p>In starting any repair job such as replacing a faucet or replacing a leaking or old pipe, the first thing to do is to shut off the water supply. Sometimes the shut off valve is located nearby, such as under a sink when replacing a sink faucet. The homeowner needs to ensure that the shut-off is complete. Sometimes, it is necessary to turn off the faucet where the water supply enters the house. Also, in certain cases after shutting off the valve it may be necessary to empty the water contained in other pipes by opening all other faucets to prevent unnecessary flooding at the repair faucet. When spills are small, a bucket and rag may be sufficient.
Another thing needed is to ensure that the correct parts are available for the job. This is possible by removing the worn part and matching the size in the store. 
Most common tools adjustable wrench, channel-lock pliers, screwdriver set, hammer, plunger, and auger. Frequently needed parts are washers and O rings, replacement faucet cartridges and toilet flappers. Among supplies, Teflon tape, pipe joint compound and plumbers’ putty will prove to be useful.
